## Alexander Karren
### Full-Stack Software Engineer

Hey, there! My name's Alex, and I'm in the Greater Salt Lake City Area of Utah building websites and web applications. I specialize in JavaScript and the React and Express frameworks, and I'm always trying to find out what new languages and tools interest me the most so I can keep learning more and more.
